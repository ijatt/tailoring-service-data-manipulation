# tailoring-service-data-manipulation
this is a simple system that i develop for subject Introduction Data Structure and Algorithm CSC248. I got 19.73 out of 20 for this :p<br />
The system uses user-defined linked list, and pre-defined Queue to manipulate the data.<br />
The data of the system is stored in the .txt.<br />
